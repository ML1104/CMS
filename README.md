### Design Details

This project was created via php OOP and mySQL communication with the database. 
The database was designed so that all tables are interlinked in order for the 
user to be able to see all the details of the product as well as be able to edit them
in the same way. This was done via MySQL workbench by making relational and non-relational
connections with the tables.
